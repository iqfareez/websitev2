Setting up signed commits is an essential step in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of your 
code contributions. By signing your commits, you provide a cryptographic assurance that the changes 
are genuinely from you, preventing unauthorized modifications. 

When you push the signed commits on GitHub, you'll get a **Verified** badge with your commits.

In this guide, we'll walk through how 
to set up signed commits on a Windows environment, ensuring that your Git contributions are both secure 
and trusted.


## Prerequisites

Install the software below on your machine.

- [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/index.html) - Includes Kleopatra & GPG tools.

## Create a PGP key pair

First, determine the email address you want to use with the key. Head to GitHub > Settings > Emails. You can use
your public email or use your GitHub's private email.

Launch **Kleopatra** and click on <kbd>New OpenPGP Key Pair...</kbd>

Fill in your **name** and **email address** you have chosen earlier. If you want to customize the key type or the expiry date, click on <kbd>Advanced Settings...</kbd>. Then, click <kbd>OK</kbd>.

A success dialog will appear, click <kbd>OK</kbd> to close it. Don't worry about the fingerprint for now. A newly created key will appear
in the dialog.

## Add GPG Key to GitHub

Go to your GitHub account > Settings > [SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).

In the **GPG keys** section, click on <kbd>New GPG key</kbd>. It will ask for a title and key. For
the **Title** field, you can put anything you would like. I usually put my computer name (to distinguish between other devices I own).

To fill the **Key** field, you'll need the public key for the key you just created. Back to Kleopatra, double-click
on the key, and click <kbd>Export</kbd>

A dialog will appear, copy everything in the dialog and paste it into the **Key** field.

Click <kbd>Add GPG Key</kbd>.

Verify that the key is added.

## Local Git setup

Open Terminal or Git Bash. 

If you haven't set up your git username and password yet, you can do it now.

```bash
git config --global user.name "myname"
git config --global user.email myemail@example.com
```

(Optional) Unset the previously set GPG key if you have set it up before this.

```bash
git config --global --unset gpg.format
```

When you install the Gpg4win earlier, it will also install gpg binaries in your system.
Locate `gpg.exe` and copy its full path. Usually installed at `"C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg.exe"`

![gpg.exe location](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1726979824/website/Git%20Signed%20commits/Screenshot_2024-09-22_123629_p7n7sd.png)

Then, tell git where the gpg program sits

```bash
git config --global gpg.program "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg.exe"
```

Set key ID from the generated key to git

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey 3AA5C343XXXXXXXX
```

Replace the key ID with your own key ID. You can find the Key ID from Kleopatra or Github.

(Optional) You can tell git to automatically sign the commits.

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

That's it, how easy it is to set up signed commits. Ask me any questions you have. For more information, please consult
the documentation.
