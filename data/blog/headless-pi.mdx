summary: Finally got one Raspberry to tinker around. It's going to be my homelab practice device. Here's a way to set up the Pi in headless mode (without monitor, keyboard & mouse).

Today, my Raspberry Pi 4 arrived. Pretty excited to finally own one. I used Raspberry Pi 3 & 4 occasionally in my Uni days previously. Now, I would like to have a little server
running at home for various projects. I didn't find the need to make it like a 'computer', i.e., with monitor, mouse & keyboards attached. Controlling it via terminal using the host machine is fine.

![raspberry-pi-cytron](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1711797473/website/RaspberryPi/IMG_1964_ngns72.jpg)

For the **host machine**, I'm using Windows 11. Connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the Pi.

## Create boot media

Grab a microSD card; 16-32Gb is fine. Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), or other imager tools like [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to burn the OS Image to the microSD card. 
I'm using the latest Raspberry Pi Bookworm 64-bit OS. Before installing, customize the OS by setting the hostname, Wi-Fi SSID & Password, enabling SSH, etc. For more info, read
the docs [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#raspberry-pi-imager).

Once the OS is installed, remove the microSD card from the host and insert it into the Raspberry Pi. Power it up. Wait for a few minutes for the first boot.

## Connect over SSH

The Raspberry Pi will automatically connect to the Wi-Fi network. From the host machine, try pinging the Pi for confirmation.

Open your Terminal and run:

```powershell
> ping raspi.local

    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 7ms, Maximum = 60ms, Average = 25ms
```

<Admonition type="note" >
`raspi` is the **hostname** I set when creating the boot media. You can replace it with your hostname. The discovery is possible
because the Raspberry Pi is using mDNS that works out of the box using avahi. If you can't ping it, try to find the IP address of the Pi using your router admin page.
</Admonition>

Now, SSH into the Pi:

```powershell
ssh iqmal@raspi.local
```

<Admonition type="note" >
`iqmal` is the **username** I set when creating the boot media. 
</Admonition>

You will be prompted to enter the password. Enter the password you set when creating the boot media. For the first time connection, you may be asked
to trust the device, etc. Then, you should now be connected to the Pi.

Great, now you access the Pi terminal which you can install software, configure, etc.

### Enable VNC

This is an optional step if you want to use the Raspberry Pi by its GUI desktop interface. This desktop interface is what you'll see
if you connect your Pi to the external monitor. Since we don't have any monitor connected physically, we can access it remotely using VNC (Virtual 
Network Computing). 

Good to note that, in Bookworm, they migrated to [**Wayland** as the display system](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/bookworm-the-new-version-of-raspberry-pi-os/#:~:text=notice%20some%20differences.-,Wayland,-The%20most%20important) rather 
than X11 used in the previous OS generation.

> Similarly, the Wayland security model prevents traditional remote desktop access, and so a new VNC server, called wayvnc, is being used instead of 
RealVNC. This is a bit more restrictive in terms of the client applications which can connect to it â€” we have had good results with the TigerVNC 
client, available [here](https://tigervnc.org/).

To enable VNC, run the following command:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

<Admonition type="warning">
I notice that, when I enable VNC **after** I do the [set default boot mode to CLI](#set-default-boot-mode-to-cli), it will create VNC config based 
on X11 backend, not wayland. This will cause the VNC viewer to show a blank screen.
</Admonition>

Navigate to `Interfacing Options` > `VNC` > `Yes`. Reboot the Pi.

On the host machine, download [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/) viewer.

Open TigerVNC viewer and enter the IP address/hostname of the Pi.

Then, enter the login username & password.

You should now see the Raspberry Pi desktop interface.

## Set default boot mode to CLI

This is also an optional step since we are not using the GUI interface that much. We can change the default boot mode
to CLI (Command Line Interface) to save some resources. We can always start a GUI anytime.

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Navigate to `System Options` > `Boot / Auto Login` > `Console Autologin`. Reboot the Pi.

To start the GUI interface if needed, from the SSH terminal, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl start lightdm
```

Connect VNC and you should see the desktop interface again.
