I needed a reliable method to access my Proxmox server and the services running on it while away from home. There were times I wanted to check on data I stored in it, push a quick update to a container, or troubleshoot an issue. Without remote access, even small tasks had to wait until I got home, which wasnâ€™t always practical.

In this guide, I'll show you how I installed Tailscale on Proxmox using an LXC container, running on my HP T610 thin client.

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is a simple, secure mesh VPN built on WireGuard that lets you easily access your Proxmox server and home network from anywhere, without complex configuration. It's an ideal solution for homelab remote access because it works across devices, is easy to manage, and keeps your connections private.

## Install Tailscale on LXC Container or on the Proxmox Host

The topic of whether to install Tailscale directly on the Proxmox host or inside an LXC container is highly debated online. While some users go for the host installation due to its simplicity and direct integration, some others and community discussions discourage this approach (see [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/17rpsgz/how_to_install_tailscale_on_proxmox_not_a_ct_or_vm/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1dmrca4/best_way_to_setup_tailscale/)), citing potential security risks and maintenance complexity. Installing Tailscale in an unprivileged LXC container is often recommended instead, as it isolates the service from the host, and reduces the attack surface.

I choose to install Tailscale on a LXC container. The steps is easy and not so complicated to follow.

## My Setup

Before we begin, let me recall my setup of my homelab setup. The information would be useful when setting up lXC container and running Tailscale.

{/* Add diagram */}

## Creating the LXC Container

First, we'll create a dedicated LXC container for Tailscale. Click on the "Create CT" button in the Proxmox web interface to start the container creation wizard. Set a cool hostname, such as `tailscale` etc. And set the root password for the container.

![LXC Container wizard](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220752/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_212743_nrlse3.png)

Note the ID of the CT we are creating, as we will need it later. For this guide, I will use `103` as the container ID. Click "Next" to proceed.

For the CT template, I just choose the Debian 12 standard template that come with Proxmox.

![LXC Template selection](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220750/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_212756_wlc2qo.png)

For Disk, CPU & Memory settings, I will use the following configuration:

- Disk: 3GB (2GB is also sufficient)
- CPU: 1 core
- Memory: 512 MB

In the network section, I set the IPV4 to DHCP, for automatic IP assignment, and will be changed at some point later in the tutorial. The rest of the network settings was be left as default.

The DNS section can be left as default. 

Below is the config summary of the LXC container that I want to create. Uncheck the "Start at boot" option for now, as we will start the container after further configuring it. Click on "Finish" to create the container.

![LXC Summary](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220752/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_212906_pzp1ud.png)

### Allow access to networking resource

Unprivileged LXC containers cannot use the `/dev/tun` device by default, which Tailscale needs to create secure network tunnels. To make Tailscale work in your container, you need to update its configuration to allow access to `/dev/tun`.

Open the configuration file (Run this on the Proxmox **host terminal**, replace `103` with your LXC container ID):

```shell
nano /etc/pve/lxc/103.conf
```

![CONTAINER ID](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220751/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_213152_q9riik.png)

Then, add the following lines in the file:

```shell
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 10:200 rwm
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net/tun dev/net/tun none bind,create=file
```

![LXC config](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220751/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_213220_fhynpb.png)

Save the file, and now you can **start the container**. If the LXC is already running it will need to be shut down and started again for this change to take effect.

## Container Initial Setup

Open your LXC Container console.

<Admonition type="note">
  For the rest of this guide, the command displayed are meant to be run inside the LXC container console. You can access the console from the Proxmox web interface by selecting the container and clicking on "Console".
</Admonition>

First, determine the IP address that is assigned to the container.

```shell
ip -a
```

![LXC container IP address output](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220750/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_213424_fghsje.png)

Then, update the container options with the IP address. Change DHCP to Static and fill in the IP Address found in the command output & Gateway IP of your setup.

![Update LXC container network options](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220749/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_213522_ril6ko.png)

Click "OK" to save the changes. The changes should take effect immediately, no need to restart the container.

You can check if the network setup is working by pinging any public domain. Eg: `ping 1.1.1.1`.

After that, return to the console and update the system packages:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

Then, install curl and sudo:
```bash
apt install curl sudo -y
```

While it is not strictly necessary to install `sudo` as we already running on root, the Tailscale documentation online often includes `sudo` in the commands, so it is much faster to copy & paste the command without manually deleting the keyword `sudo`.

## Install & Configure Tailscale

Run the command below to install Tailscale in your LXC container:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

We will configure Tailscale as a **subnet router**, which allows devices on your Tailscale network to access your local network through this container. This is particularly useful for accessing your Proxmox host and other devices on your home network.

From Tailscale [docs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets):
> Subnet routers let you extend your Tailscale network (known as a tailnet) to include devices that don't or can't run the Tailscale client. They act as gateways between your tailnet and physical subnets, enabling secure access to legacy devices, entire networks, or services without installing Tailscale everywhere. 

In the CT console, run the following command to allow IP forwarding, which is required for subnet routing:

```shell
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
echo 'net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
```

![ipv4 forwarding](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220780/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_214053_lj4pf4.png)

We are almost done, now we can start the Tailscale and advertise your local network routes.

```bash
tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.1.0/24 --advertise-exit-node
```

Replace the IP `192.168.1.0/24` with your Gateway IP and change the last IP section with 0. You can omit the `--advertise-exit-node` flag but I would like to advertise this node as an exit node.

![Tailscale up](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220779/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_214219_abgqkh.png)

You should be prompted to authenticate your Tailscale account. Follow the link given to authenticate yourself. It would output "SUCCESS" once you have successfully authenticated.

Now, if you open your Tailscale [Admin Dashboard](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines), you should see your device shown.

![tailscale admin dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220779/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_214249_c48pqq.png)

But if you notice, the chip "Subnets" & "Exit Node" are not yet approved (as shown by the exclaimation icon). Tailscale requires you to manually approve subnet routes and exit nodes for security reasons. Click in the three dots next to the device name and select "Edit Routes".

![tailscale approve route](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1749220779/website/tailscale-proxmox/Screenshot_2025-06-06_214304_otgpfm.png)

Approve the changes by checking the "Subnet routes" and "Exit Node" options, then click "Save".

Optionally, you can disable key expiry so that your Tailscale connection remains active without needing to re-authenticate frequently.

## Accessing Proxmox Remotely

Now you can access your Proxmox web interface from anywhere using the it's IP like you would do as if you're in your home network (by 'home network', I mean devices that connected to the same Wifi/Lan).

To test this out, use another device connected to a network other than your home network (e.g., mobile data or a different Wi-Fi). Connect to Tailscale on that device.

Normally, without Tailscale, just the home network, I will access my Proxmox via `https://192.168.1.233:8006`. Now, on that test device, go to the same IP and you should be able to access your Proxmox Web!

Not just Proxmox, other services on that server too!

## Conclusion

With this setup, you can securely access your Proxmox environment and home network from anywhere in the world. Remember to regularly update both your container and Tailscale installation to maintain security and performance.

Happy homelabbing! ðŸš€
