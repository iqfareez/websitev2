In this tutorial, I'll show you how to enable & set up Android wireless debugging using the command line for Android 11 or later (Android 10 and lower have a slightly different method). 

## Prerequisites

- [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) (Android Debug Bridge)
- Host machine (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
- Physical Android device
- Wifi network

You can download adb from Android Studio or as standalone installations. Make sure the path to the adb executables is added to PATH. For example, if you're on Windows, adb
is located in the `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe`.

You can check if adb is ready by running the command `adb --version`.

Please enable the Developer Options first if you haven't done so. See this [guide](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-get-developer-options-on-android/).

Both the host machine and Android device need to be on the same Wifi network.

Some public/university wifi networks have restrictions and can't be used for wireless debugging.

## Pairing

On your Android device. Go to Settings > Developer Options. Scroll down and tap on the Wireless Debugging section.

Open Terminal on the host machine. Enter the following command (Replace `IPADDRESS` & `PORT` with the IP address & Port shown on the Android device):

```shell
adb pair IPADDRESS:PORT
```

After successful pairing, the host machine will appear in the list of paired devices.

## Connect to the device

Whenever you want to connect to the device, you can use the following command (Replace `IPADDRESS` & `PORT` with the IP address & Port shown on the Android device):

```shell
adb connect IPADDRESS:PORT
```

Check devices connected to ADB by running `adb devices`.
