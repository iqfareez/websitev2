There's something uniquely satisfying about breathing new life into old hardware. I was doom-scrolling on Carousell to find cheap or free items people wanted to let go. Then, I stumbled upon an HP T610 thin client for just RM 60 (~USD 13). I liked the form factor that wouldn't take up much space, and the specs were quite OK in my opinion.

This post documents my journey of transforming this modest machine into a capable home serverâ€”complete with hardware upgrades, software configuration, and the occasional troubleshooting adventure. If you're considering starting your own homelab on a budget, I hope my experience provides both inspiration and practical guidance.

## Project Overview

1. [Hardware Upgrades](#hardware-upgrades)
2. Proxmox Installation
3. Open Media Vault Setup
4. Container Applications with Portainer
5. Lessons Learned & Future Plans
6. Conclusion

1. **Hardware Acquisition & Upgrades**
   - Finding the HP T610 on Carousell
   - Adding an SSD for the operating system
   - Installing a larger HDD for storage
   - Upgrading RAM to a total of 8GB
   - Modding the case with additional cooling

2. **Proxmox Installation & Setup**

   - Installation process and initial configuration
   - Network configuration challenges and solutions
   - Resource allocation planning

3. **Open Media Vault Implementation**
   - Setting up OMV as a virtual machine
   - Storage configuration and management
   - File sharing setup (SMB/NFS)
   - Backup strategies

4. **Container Applications with Portainer**
   - Why I chose containerization over more VMs
   - Setting up Portainer for container management
   - Essential services I'm running (e.g., Plex, Home Assistant, etc.)
   - Resource management and performance considerations

5. **Lessons Learned & Future Plans**
