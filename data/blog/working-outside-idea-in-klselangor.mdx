For people who are working remotely, or entitled to work from home, sometimes staying in the same place every day can be tiring. A
fresh environment is needed to boost work productivity and improve focus. Below is a curated list of places
that I have personally visited.

<br />

- Located on the 2nd floor, near the escalator, at the old wing.
- Need to buy something to sit there, I usually buy iced coffee and chocolate bread (~rm20)
- Free Wifi (password in their receipt). Fast (>50 Mbps) - but during my work, the wifi was lost for a moment (maybe about 3 minutes), so
  you need to consider especially when you need a constant connection (e.g., in an online call, etc.)
- Your view will be some shops and a merry-go-round on the ground floor
- The noise is non-intrusive, you can still focus on your work
- Can be a bit busy during lunch hour onwards
- Comfortable chill
- Limited seating (about 6 tables if I recall correctly)
- Comfortable sitting, but the table is small. Maybe it can be an issue if you have a lot of stuff or want to use your mouse, idk.
- Plug point only available at the high stool table, near the barista counter (Only two slots)

### Charging Station @ IOI Mall Puchong

- Located on the 3rd floor, old wing. They have two stations. One near MrDiy, another one near the escalator.
- High-stool seating. Not comfortable, sit for like 5 min already feel neck and butt pain
- Cannot lean back, you'll be forced to sit straight
- Leg hanging in the air, not comfortable and pain (not a problem if you're tall ðŸ˜†)
- The stool is screwed to the ground, can't move it closer to the table
- The table is spacious, can put some stuff comfortably
- Comfortable temperature, non-intrusive noise
- Have plug point for each seat (since it's a charging station anyway)
- If you choose the one near MrDiy, you can receive the Wifi from Zus Coffee below (hehe)

<br />

- Located on the ground floor, old wing. Just outside the AEON supermarket.
- Spacious table & comfortable seat
- Not necessarily to buy anything from the food court, but if you want to, there are a lot of choices.
- No free wifi
- The music is louder. The environment is noisier from people chatting, shopping, etc. Can be a bit distracting. Bring your ANC headphones.
- if hungry, easily can grab food from the food court, bakery, or supermarket
- The AC is less chill, but still comfortable and doesn't interrupt productivity

#### IOI Mall Puchong overall:

There are a few more cafes to sit and work in there. Parking is RM2 per entry. RM1 for the next hour. Public transport (LRT) is
5 minutes walk away.

<br />

- Located at Skypod Residence, Puchong. Behind IOI Business Park. [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oMuf4SywBn1EDgVo7)
- I come here using public transport. It's 10-15 minutes walk from LRT IOI Puchong. Therefore I cannot comment about parking.
- One day pass will cost you RM 25. Register and pay at the counter. You'll be given an access card for you to enter/exit the office.
- Pantry available with coffee, tea, biscuits, and water.
- Wifi provided (password will be given to your WhatsApp upon registration). Speed is fast ~80 Mbps
- Almost free sitting - the staff will tell you which area can be sit
- Hammock available at leisure area (but the chain sound is noisy and annoying)
- Have 'cabin' for private meeting (no need to book, you can access if it is unoccupied)
- Environment is nice, quiet, comfortable and chill. Not many people around, perfect for focus session.
- Staff is nice and friendly
- No surau (prayer room) inside. But, you can use the surau in the IOI Business Park, located on the ground floor near the toilet and elevators.
- Hard to find food when lunch. There is only one mamak and Chinese restaurant available. However, I'm not sure if there are any other restaurants in IOI Business Park.

## LaLaport Bukit Bintang

A calm not-so-crowded mall in the middle of KL. Accessible using public transport, the mall is connected to LRT Hang Tuah Station. [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dmYDiPvpELG9CiWF8)

- Go to level 4, find [The Garden Dining](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eR1pb1cQ5YLqFigK6), basically a food court - a large food court.
- Comfortable seat, spacious table. Not crowded during working hour.
- Plug point is available at some seats. It's limited, so you need to find the right seat.
- Some areas are already designated for work. It is called [**Lala Flexi Hub**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteworkmalaysia/permalink/734641815201319/?mibextid=Nif5oz).
- No free wifi. Mobile network coverage is good.
- The AC is chill, but not too cold. Comfortable, but bring your sweater.
- You can see some people and students also doing their work here.
- At the back, they have like a mini playground for kids.
- Moderate noise level. Not too quiet, not too noisy. You can still focus on your work.
- Toilet is accessible easily
- Since this area is large, I've changed my seats like 4-5 times during break.
- During break time, you can go to the rooftop to get some fresh air. As a bonus, you can also see the Merdeka 118 building from there. You can also wander
  around the mall area, there are a lot of shops and restaurants.
- Since you're sitting in a food court itself, finding food during lunch/break shouldn't be a problem.

- Located on Level 1, near the escalator
- To sit there, you need to **buy something from the cafe**. I bought a cup of coffee and a slice of cake (~rm20). A hot vanilla latte
  in the evening is definitely so refreshing.

- The seats are enough; not so many, not so few.
- **Plug point** is available.
- Have free public Wifi - **High speed** (but beware of the security)
