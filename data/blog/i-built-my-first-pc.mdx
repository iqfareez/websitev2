  This post was originally written and published on Jan 2026, but I backdated it to 
  Sept 2024 (the actual date the PC was built) to fit the blog's chronological order.
</Admonition>

I built my first desktop PC recently, and I wanted to document the experience and share some insights here, perhaps helpful for some of you out there whose considering building their own.

## Let's start off with the Why(s)?

Well, I think I'm in a situation that demands more computing power. Currently, I'm using Asus Laptop with upgraded specs. Insert processor model here 256 SSD, 1 TB Storage & 12 GB RAM DDR4.

I choose to build a PC rather than buying a new laptop because I wanted to have more control over the components and their quality. Plus, building a PC can be more cost-effective for the performance you get. Also, just for the fun of it!

## The Build

I shop the components not in one shot, but rather one by one over the span of a month due to the budget. The list below is based on actual cronological order of purchase. Product link and prices will be linked at the end of this section.

## The Storage

My old laptop was limited in term of storage spaces, so I went to the high capacity SSD. The tech was upgraded from the past too (SATA to NVMe) for the better performance. This was the first time I bought an SSD with the capacity but fortunately the prices of it has go down over the past years until I feel it's quite affordable.

## The Case

The case is the most important part of the build, as it houses all the components and provides cooling. I went for a mid-tower case with good airflow and cable management options. The case also has a tempered glass side panel, which allows me to show off the internal components. This case also have mostly positive reviews on the market, which led to to choose it.

## The CPU

Despite the importance of the CPU in a PC build, it rather easy to decide which CPU I wanted. Intel vs AMD? AMD is cheaper and have better multi-core performance for the price. AM4 or AM5?[^1] AM5 is still new, the prices is higher compared to AM4. With AM5, I can use the latest DDR5 RAM for better performance. I made my mind to future-proof my build, so I choose AM5 platform for this build and went with Ryzen 5 7600.

[Ryzen 5 7600](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-5-7600.html) has 6 cores and 12 threads (wow!). It has a base clock speed of 3.8 GHz and a boost clock speed of up to 5.1 GHz. It may not super powerful or whatever but the specs blown me away for the price that I can afford.

My friend also chooses this CPU for [his build](https://youtu.be/Cu4qR6zpRIw) too!

## The Motherboard

The backbone of the PC. Again, AM5 peripherals tends to have higher prices compared to AM4 counterparts. I went for budget friendly motherboard with decent features; [ASRock A620M-HDV/M.2](https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/A620M-HDVM.2/index.asp). I figure I won't be doing any overclocking or whatsoever, so this motherboard is sufficient for my needs.

Some features of this motherboard includes:

- **AMD Socket AM5** - Supports Ryzen™ 9000, 8000 and 7000 Series Processors
- **DDR5 Memory** - 2 DIMM slots supporting Dual Channel, up to 6400+ (OC)
- **PCIe 4.0 x16** - For dedicated graphics card
- **NVMe Storage** - 1 Hyper M.2 slot (PCIe Gen4x4) for high-speed SSD

It covers all the essentials I need without the premium features I won't use.

## The Power Supply Unit (PSU)

Without it, the PC won't turn on 😂. It was pretty difficult to choose the Wattage of the PSU I wanted. As higher wattage come with higher prices but lower wattage would not give extra headroom for future upgrades. I surveyed the power consumption that my PC would be needed using [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) so I have the generic idea of what wattage my system will require.

Oh, that's not so much power required. So I went for 550W PSU which I think if optimally enough for my build.

[^1]: AM4 and AM5 are AMD's CPU socket types. AM4 is the older, more established platform (released 2016) with a wide range of compatible CPUs and motherboards at lower prices. AM5 is the newer platform (released 2022) supporting the latest Ryzen 7000+ series processors with features like DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0, but at higher prices.
