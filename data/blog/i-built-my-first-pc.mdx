<Admonition type="note">
  This post was originally written and published on Jan 2026, but I backdated it to 
  Sept 2024 (the actual date the PC was built) to fit the blog's chronological order.
</Admonition>

I built my first desktop PC recently, and I wanted to document the experience and share some insights here, perhaps helpful for some of you out there whose considering building their own.

## Let's start off with the Why(s)?

Well, I think I'm in a situation that demands more computing power. Currently, I'm using Asus Laptop with upgraded specs. Insert processor model here 256 SSD, 1 TB Storage & 12 GB RAM DDR4.

I choose to build a PC rather than buying a new laptop because I wanted to have more control over the components and their quality. Plus, building a PC can be more cost-effective for the performance you get. Also, just for the fun of it!

## Finding the Parts

I shop the components not in one shot, but rather one by one over the span of a month due to the budget. The list below is based on actual cronological order of purchase. Product link and prices will be linked at the end of this section.

### The Storage

My old laptop was limited in term of storage spaces, so I went to the high capacity SSD. The tech was upgraded from the past too (SATA to NVMe) for the better performance. This was the first time I bought an SSD with the capacity but fortunately the prices of it has go down over the past years until I feel it's quite affordable.

### The Case

The case is the most important part of the build, as it houses all the components and provides cooling. I went for a mid-tower case with good airflow and cable management options. The case also has a tempered glass side panel, which allows me to show off the internal components. This case also have mostly positive reviews on the market, which led to to choose it.

### The CPU

Despite the importance of the CPU in a PC build, it rather easy to decide which CPU I wanted. Intel vs AMD? AMD is cheaper and have better multi-core performance for the price. AM4 or AM5?[^1] AM5 is still new, the prices is higher compared to AM4. With AM5, I can use the latest DDR5 RAM for better performance. I made my mind to future-proof my build, so I choose AM5 platform for this build and went with Ryzen 5 7600.

[Ryzen 5 7600](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-5-7600.html) has 6 cores and 12 threads (wow!). It has a base clock speed of 3.8 GHz and a boost clock speed of up to 5.1 GHz. It may not super powerful or whatever but the specs blown me away for the price that I can afford.

My friend also chooses this CPU for [his build](https://youtu.be/Cu4qR6zpRIw) too!

### The Motherboard

The backbone of the PC. Again, AM5 peripherals tends to have higher prices compared to AM4 counterparts. I went for budget friendly motherboard with decent features; [ASRock A620M-HDV/M.2](https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/A620M-HDVM.2/index.asp). I figure I won't be doing any overclocking or whatsoever, so this motherboard is sufficient for my needs.

Some features of this motherboard includes:

- **AMD Socket AM5** - Supports Ryzen™ 9000, 8000 and 7000 Series Processors
- **DDR5 Memory** - 2 DIMM slots supporting Dual Channel, up to 6400+ (OC)
- **PCIe 4.0 x16** - For dedicated graphics card
- **NVMe Storage** - 1 Hyper M.2 slot (PCIe Gen4x4) for high-speed SSD

It covers all the essentials I need without the premium features I won't use.

### The Memory

Like the storage issue, I struggle too with low RAM capacity on my previous laptop. Often time I need more amount of RAM for the work that I do. In 2024, I think 16 GB is the new minimum for a decent PC build. I could have gone with 32 GB to future proof the build, but that would have put me over budget.

16 GB is sufficient for my needs right now. I consider it's an upgrade from my previous 12 GB RAM laptop (DDR4). DDR5 speed perhaps could compensate the lower capacity a bit.

I picked up [XPG Lancer DDR5 16 GB 6000 MHz CL30](https://www.xpg.com/us/xpg/dram-modules-lancer-rgb-ddr5). I choose the lowest CL (CAS Latency) for better performance. It comes with RGB too!

### The Power Supply Unit (PSU)

Without it, the PC won't turn on 😂. It was pretty difficult to choose the Wattage of the PSU I wanted. As higher wattage come with higher prices but lower wattage would not give extra headroom for future upgrades. I surveyed the power consumption that my PC would be needed using [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) so I have the generic idea of what wattage my system will require.

Oh, that's not so much power required. So I went for 550W PSU which I think if optimally enough for my build.

### The Graphics Card

The graphics card does not include in the initial build due to budget. I only get it 6 months later after saving up some money. I aiming specifically for NVIDIA GPU. Because it has good support for development, AI (with CUDA), and for sure, gaming.

I bought the [GALAX NVIDIA RTX 4060 1-CLICK OC 2X V2 8GB](https://galax.com/en/product/geforce-rtx-4060-1-click-oc-2x-v2/). The GPU is the most basic in its 40 series lineup, but the performance and power efficiency is improved. I didn't gaming that much anyway, so this GPU is sufficient for my needs.

Oh, before I was using this GPU, I was rocking on onboard AMD Ryzen graphics. It was [good actually for gaming](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYQUY-QOVAx_j3n4bsx6dcgFtHunSzNB1&si=pJ4YfuM_yDUOXu0y) and general use.

## Build Process

Building the PC was an exciting experience. You need to refer to the manual of each component most of the times. If manual didn't contain something you need, looks at the component manufacturer's website for more information. If still didn't help, go look up on forum sites like Reddit etc.

I documented the whole build process on YouTube:

- Part 2: Coming soon

## Problems & Troubleshooting

TODO: Ram issue max 6000


[^1]: AM4 and AM5 are AMD's CPU socket types. AM4 is the older, more established platform (released 2016) with a wide range of compatible CPUs and motherboards at lower prices. AM5 is the newer platform (released 2022) supporting the latest Ryzen 7000+ series processors with features like DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0, but at higher prices.
