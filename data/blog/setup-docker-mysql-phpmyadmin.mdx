Setting up MySQL and PhpMyAdmin doesn't have to be a hassle—especially for developers. With Docker, you can launch both 
in just a few commands, creating a powerful database environment right on your machine. In this guide, I'll show you 
how to quickly get everything running, making your development process smoother and faster. Let's get started!


## Prerequisites

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if you haven't already. It makes it easier to
interact with Docker using GUI or CLI.

## Create containers

Open terminal, run the command to create a Docker **network**.

```bash
docker network create mynetwork1
```

You can rename `mynetwork` with your own name, but make sure all the commands following use the same name.

<Admonition type="note">
The `--network` flag is used to create and manage container networks. When you create 
containers on the same custom Docker network, they can communicate with each other using 
container names as hostnames.
</Admonition>

Next, create a MySQL container.

```bash
docker run -d --name mysql-container --network mynetwork1 -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true -p 3306:3306 mysql:latest
```

You'll need to specify one of the following as an **environment variable** (the `-e` flag):
- **MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD**
- **MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD** (Used in the example above to allow login to MySQL without a password)
- **MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD**

Read more about MySQL environment [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql#:~:text=tag%20%2D%2Dverbose%20%2D%2Dhelp-,Environment%20Variables,-When%20you%20start).

Then, create a PhpMyAdmin container instance.

```bash
docker run -d --name phpmyadmin-container --network mynetwork1 -e PMA_HOST=mysql-container -e PMA_PORT=3306 -p 8080:80 phpmyadmin
```

In the `PMA_HOST` variable above, we set the name of the MySQL container we have created above.

Now, both of the containers should be running. You can check their status by running `docker ps`.
```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES
11db916fa868   phpmyadmin     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   10 hours ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp                phpmyadmin-container
1ed0cec416c5   mysql:latest   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   10 hours ago   Up 22 seconds       0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   mysql-container
```

Now, let's try to log into PhpMyAdmin. Launch http://localhost:8080 on your web browser. If you didn't specify the username
in the step above, the default one will be `root`.

## Import existing database to MySQL

You can now interact with the database including importing an existing `.sql` file using PhpMyAdmin interface. But sometimes, if you 
upload a large file, an error will occur like below.

To fix this kind of error, you may need to inspect the PhpMyAdmin container and modify some php configs etc. But what 
I found easier is to use **mysql CLI** from the mysql container. Here's how you can do it using Docker Desktop GUI.

Open the `mysql-container` container.

![Docker Desktop open container](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1727601196/website/docker-mysql/Screenshot_2024-09-29_at_6.54.07_AM_vkaj1e.png)

Navigate to the **Files** tab.

![Docker Files tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1727601197/website/docker-mysql/Screenshot_2024-09-29_at_6.48.54_AM_awr88n.png)

It will show the container's filesystem files. Find the `home` folder, right-click on it and choose <kbd>Import</kbd>.

![Docker files import](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1727601195/website/docker-mysql/Screenshot_2024-09-29_at_6.50.04_AM_lad5k1.png)

Choose the `.sql` file you want to import. After choosing, the file will appear under the `home` folder.

![Docker Imported Files](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1727601196/website/docker-mysql/Screenshot_2024-09-29_at_6.50.58_AM_u5370m.png)

Now, navigate to the **Exec** tab and run the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p smartquran < home/smartquran.sql
```

The `-p` flag is the table name, you can create one using PhpMyAdmin console.

![Docker Exec mysql](https://res.cloudinary.com/iqfareez-cloud/image/upload/v1727601196/website/docker-mysql/Screenshot_2024-09-29_at_6.58.05_AM_kqlbua.png)

Done! You can check your data from PhpMyAdmin console to verify that the import was successful.
