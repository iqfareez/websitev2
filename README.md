This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) blogging starter template. Version 2 is based on Next App directory with [React Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) and uses [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to manage markdown content.

Probably the most feature-rich Next.js markdown blogging template out there. Easily configurable and customizable. Perfect as a replacement to existing Jekyll and Hugo individual blogs.

Check out the documentation below to get started.
